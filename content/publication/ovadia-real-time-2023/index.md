abstract: Extrapolation remains a grand challenge in deep neural networks across all
  application domains. We propose an operator learning method to solve time-dependent
  partial differential equations (PDEs) continuously and with extrapolation in time
  without any temporal discretization. The proposed method, named Diffusion-inspired
  Temporal Transformer Operator (DiTTO), is inspired by latent diffusion models and
  their conditioning mechanism, which we use to incorporate the temporal evolution
  of the PDE, in combination with elements from the transformer architecture to improve
  its capabilities. Upon training, DiTTO can make inferences in real-time. We demonstrate
  its extrapolation capability on a climate problem by estimating the temperature
  around the globe for several years, and also in modeling hypersonic flows around
  a double-cone. We propose different training strategies involving temporal-bundling
  and sub-sampling and demonstrate performance improvements for several benchmarks,
  performing extrapolation for long time intervals as well as zero-shot super-resolution
  in time.
