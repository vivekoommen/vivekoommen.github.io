	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09072},
	abstract = {Extrapolation remains a grand challenge in deep neural networks across all application domains. We propose an operator learning method to solve time-dependent partial differential equations ({PDEs}) continuously and with extrapolation in time without any temporal discretization. The proposed method, named Diffusion-inspired Temporal Transformer Operator ({DiTTO}), is inspired by latent diffusion models and their conditioning mechanism, which we use to incorporate the temporal evolution of the {PDE}, in combination with elements from the transformer architecture to improve its capabilities. Upon training, {DiTTO} can make inferences in real-time. We demonstrate its extrapolation capability on a climate problem by estimating the temperature around the globe for several years, and also in modeling hypersonic flows around a double-cone. We propose different training strategies involving temporal-bundling and sub-sampling and demonstrate performance improvements for several benchmarks, performing extrapolation for long time intervals as well as zero-shot super-resolution in time.},
